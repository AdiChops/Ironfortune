# Ironfortune
A text-based fighting game allowing to fight randomly generated enemies that are built to scale to the player's current level
## Main Idea
The main idea is a Pokémon-style game where the user starts off with 3 basic moves that they can use an unlimited amount of times. The user would have to fight random enemies and they can use items to improve their moves. The users will also receive a random item at certain intervals.
## Enemies
At random intervals, there would be random enemies that would show up with a pre-determined set of moves. Different enemies would have different moves.
## Levels
There is a concept of leveling up. The user would level up based on the XP they get from fighting enemies/winning fights. Buying items could also give them XP and using certain moves could give them an XP boost. As users level up, they get higher-leveled enemies and defeating enemies can also give them XP boosts.
## Moves
Each move would have damage points, which would do damage to either opponent (user or enemy). The damage points would do a certain amount of damage to the health of an opponent (a move’s damage points would reduce the opponent’s health by that amount, e.g. if a move does 50 damage, then the opponent’s health is reduced by half). Users could purchase more moves for the maximum of 6 moves. Any non-basic move would have a limit to how many times it can be used during battle. Some moves can heal the player.
## Coins
The user would have a certain amount of coins which they can use to buy more items or moves. If users want to buy another move, but they are already at 6 moves, they can sell the move for a specific amount of coins (less than it was purchased for, and they can’t sell any of their 3 basic moves).

## User Health
If a user reaches 0 health, they will lose a certain amount of XP, depending on the level they are at. After each match, the user’s health regenerates to the full amount.
## Other Things
Since the game is text-based, there will be certain commands to use a move. If I have the time, I may include a guide to fully explain the move/item in more detail, but when buying items/moves, there will be a brief description about the it.
While discussing my project with other classmates, one classmate (Amelie) had the idea of including terminal graphics, which I also liked and may include in my project.

## Potential Extensions
There are many potential extensions to this project, for example:
- The enemies could have random items to make their moves more powerful
- A wider variety of enemies could be added
- A wider variety of items could be added
  - Additional items can have different abilities
- A wider variety of moves could be added
- A graphical component could be added
- A “mana” component could be added, where the user would use a certain amount of mana per specialized move
